# Building a Serverless Architecture
In this lab, I configure an **Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)** bucket to invoke an **Amazon SNS notification** 
whenever an object is added to an S3 bucket. You learn how to create and interact with **SQS queues**, 
and learn how to invoke an AWS Lambda function using Amazon SQS. 
This scenario will help you understand how you can architect your application to respond to Amazon S3 bucket events
 using serverless services such as Amazon SNS, AWS Lambda, and Amazon SQS.
